# Rubi's Corner

This is a cafe website designed to display menus to costumers and allow them to make, edit and delete reservations. It's a full-stack framework project built using HTML, CSS, Python, Django and javaScript.

## UX
### Strategy

The users will be looking for:
* An website that provides good information and easy to find & concise
* A way to contact the Cafe
* A menu that show what the cafe provides
* A booking form to make reservation, edit and delete
* An user account to log in in to make reservations
* Allow users to sign up for a newsletter

# UX
## Strategy:

Using the core UX principles, I first started with strategy. Thinking about what the user will be looking for in the Cafe.

The users will be looking for:
* A website that provides good information and is easy to find & concise
* A way to contact the Cafe
* A menu that shows what the cafe provides
* A booking form to make reservation, edit and delete
* An user account to log in in to make reservations
* Allow users to sign up for a newsletter

---
## User Stories:

Follow the link to find my defined user stories and their criteria [here](https://github.com/EmmaRubiH/Rubis-Corner/issues).

1. As a user I can get key information about the restaurant at the landing page so that I can spend less time search for info.
2. As a user I need to sign in so that I can make a booking.
3. As a owner I can manage all booking so that the restaurant don't get over booked.
4. As a user I can access my booking so that I can edit if needed.
5. As a user I can access my booking so that I can cancel my booking.
6. As a user I can sign up for a newsletter so that I can get info and news from the restaurant.
7. As a user I can view menu so that I can get inspiration before visit.
8. As a user I can book a table at the restaurant for date and time.
9. As a user I can see message on the site when i havesuccess with log in/sign up. 
10. As a admin user I can **log in ** so that I can access the site's backend.

---
## Scope:

* Landing page with information about the cafe.
* Menu page, with buttons to view the food and drinks menu.
* Responsive navbar that will navigate to different pages throughout the site.
* Reservation page, with a booking form.
* Register/login using Django allauth.
* Contact info and opening hours.

---
## Structure:

The information above was then used to create a structure for the website.
The site map shows how users can navigate the website intuitively.


<details><summary>Sitemap</summary>

---
## Skeleton:

Wireframes were created to set the appearance of the website. Created them using Balsamiq.

The finished project is different from the original mockup.

### Surface:

## Color:

The color palette i chose for this website was grey, white and yellow. I wanted a 'clean' feel and based it on grey to keep in theme with Rubis Corner. The corners of a building can usually be concrete. I wanted the feeling of the name to follow along with the coloring and the theme in the website.While building the site I felt that the feeling could be a little dark, so I chose to add yellow to brighten it up and the feeling could be softer.

And the text colors are black and white smoke throughout the site.

![coolers](/static/media/coolors.png)

## Font:
For fonts, I chose 'Poiret One' and 'Montserrat'.

## Images:
All the images were taken from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/sv/).

## Future Featurs:

Some features i would like for this app are:

* Avoid over bookings.
* Newsletter mail. After the user has signed up for the newsletter, an email should be sent with information.
* Confirmation email. An email that is sent to the user after they have made a booking, edited or canceled the reservation.

# Bugs

1. Had problems loading all the styling on the base.html page.
   * I hade not write the right code to the url link {% static 'css/style.css' %}. (i forgot the css)

2. Css problem. Not showing up when the site was deployed.
   * When i deployed the website to heroku, the site looked different. The CSS was not appearing.
   * I searched on the web after an explanation and ideas. Did not find an answer. But then I started to search at SLACK and found the answer.
   * I had before changed the DEBUG to 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ and removed DISABLE COLLECTSTAIC in heroku. What I learned now from SLACK was that I needed to write (python manage.py collectstatic --noinput) in the terminal and then commit (git push heroku).
   * And then the CSS finally worked.

3. The booking page error.
   * I had problems with booking a table page.
   * It said that the booking model did not exist.
   * I searched in slack to figure it out. And after a while I realized that I had forgotten to migrate the last migrations.

4. New uppdate coused errors
  * With the new updates for heroku, I started to have problems with my site.
  * I followed along with Code Institutes walkthrough to migrate to heroku. 
  * I did everything thoroughly one more time, then I realized that I had not saved the right URL from ElephantSQL.
  * When I now do everything the right way, it worked.
